## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Nuo Xiang Yan, and I am an avid reader of all kinds of genres who loves to debate about philosophy, and one of the things I treasure dearly is the DnD campaign I and my friends play together. I love creating interesting ideas and exploring them in depth, seeing how simple changes produce fascinating results. Personal interests aside, I approach engineering with a principled exactness, holding myself up to a level that I am, at the very least, satisfied with. I excel best when guided, but have some freedom to make choices, and consider myself fairly understanding of myriad perspectives and even handed in my judgement. 

Take a look at <a href="/projects/">my projects</a> and <a href="/fa25-portfolio-ny227/assets/CV.pdf">CV</a>.
