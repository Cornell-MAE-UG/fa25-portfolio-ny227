As part of a class project, we came up with multiple designs for an ice scraper and prototyped various versions, seeing what was feasible and what wasn't. We started off by taking multiple interviews of people about troubles or pain points when it comes to traveling in winter weather, and then came up with multiple designs. After narrowing them down to one we would prototype, we attempted to create a small scale version of it.
